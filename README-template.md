## Overview
This challenge was difficult for me to fully utilize all that I know about the subject that I had to do a lot of research on what is the best approach,
I started with how to center the card given and apply the colors using the measurements of rem and vw and learning when and why to use them, afterwards adjusting measurements, positioning of elements and assigning the right names to classes in HTML was all challenging.
Reached a point where I felt confused and didn't know how to approach this so I started searching others solutions and best practices used to approach such a challenge with CSS and how to optimize the code.
solutions were really helpful to sit and study the approachs and relax my own style, others seem to have it well planned and well structured revising my own code and approach brought back all that I have learned and was a great refresher to my learning.

### The challenge
